# ADR-001: Use ADRs

## Status 

Active

## Context

The same [like this unrelated project](https://github.com/arachne-framework/architecture/blob/master/adr-001-use-adrs.md) and other projects using ADRs.

For more info about ADRs see [link 1][1], [link 2][2] and [link 3][3] 

## Consequences

All the usual benefits of ADRs, and in particular:

1. project design decisions will be documented explicitly, and onboarding of new members is simplified
2. active ADRs can be used as guideline for reviewing new code, features and design proposals
3. proposal ADRs can be used for discussing changes to the project, or for creating a tree of forks, in the spirit of ADR-002
