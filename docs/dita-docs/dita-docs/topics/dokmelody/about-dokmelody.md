# Dokmelody

Dokmelody is a federated system for programming and sharing information between individual users, groups and communities.

Every group or community can decide what to share, and what to not. Information from other groups and communities can be imported and in case forked. In this way, different groups and communities can take advantage of each others, despite having different needs and missions, because it is not an all-or-nothing type of collaboration.

In future, hopefully, Dokmelody will also manage donations and transparent revenue sharing between users and service providers. Every provider can share part of its revenues to other providers and maintainers from which it depends, in an hierarchical fashion. In this way, end user applications and services that are likely to receive donations from end-users, can sustain the infrastructure they are using.
