In this blog I will document the design and development of Dokmelody.

Dokmelody is both a programming language (Dok), a knowledge-base (Doknil), an IDE (Tuttology) and a way for pubblishing information on the internet (Dokmelody).

I started the implementation of Dokmelody using [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp), because it is a very fun language to use, thanks to its interactive REPL.

Instead of Git, I'm using [Jujutsu (jj)](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj), because it a lot easier to use. Jujutsu can freely push/pull from/to ordinary Git branches, so I can collaborate with other programmers using Git. [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dokmelody/scratch) is the reference repository.

For the [documentation](/docs/topics/about.html), I'm using [DITA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture), because I like the way you can navigate in documentation.

I selected the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/), respect something like  [LGPL-v3+](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html), because it makes more sense for a programming language using many macro. The details about the decision are described in [ADR-003: Use MIT and CC-BY-4.0 licenses](/docs/topics/references/ADR/ADR-003-use-MIT-and-CC-BY-licenses.html).
