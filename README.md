# Dokmelody

Dokmelody is a federated system for programming and sharing information between individual users, groups and communities. 

Dokmelody will be composed of:

- the Dok programming language;
- the Doknil knowledge-base language, for linking the various parts of a project;
- the Tuttology IDE
- the Dokmelody services for running the federation of servers

## Status

Early alpha: nothing of useful.

## This repo

This repo contains scratch/throw-away code, for testing some Dokmelody ideas.

## Contacts

See [https://www.dokmelody.org](https://www.dokmelody.org) for more information.

## Quick start

Enable `.envrc` that loads the `guix.scm` environment with needed development tools.

Execute 

``` shell
just -l 
```

inside every directory for showing the content of `justfile` and related commands.
